# Project Requirements Analysis

**TASK:**
1.  **LOCATE & READ**: Search for and read the content of the file named `project_requirements.md` in the root directory.
    * *If the file does not exist:* Stop immediately and inform me. Ask if you should create a template for it.

2.  **ANALYZE**: specific focus on the following areas:
    * **Project Goal**: What is the primary problem we are solving?
    * **Tech Stack**: Identify any strict technology constraints (e.g., Next.js, Python, specific databases).
    * **Features**: List the core features described in the document.

3.  **SYNTHESIZE**:
    * Create a brief bulleted summary of the "Critical Path" (the most important things to build first).
    * Check for any potential conflicts between the requirements and my current active Rules (e.g., if the docs say "Use Bootstrap" but the Rule says "Use Shadcn", flag this conflict immediately).

4.  **AWAIT INSTRUCTION**:
    * End your response by asking: "Which feature from the requirements should we start building first?"
