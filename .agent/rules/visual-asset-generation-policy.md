# Visual Asset Generation Policy

**DIRECTIVE:**
You are prohibited from using generic placeholders (e.g., colored divs, `placehold.co`, or empty `<img>` tags) when the UI requires visual assets.

**MANDATORY TOOL USAGE:**
When a project requirement or UI design calls for an image, icon, or illustration, you must use **Nano Banana Pro** to generate it.

**WORKFLOW:**
1.  **IDENTIFY**: Detect where an image would enhance the UI (e.g., "Hero Section Background," "Feature Icons," "User Avatar").
2.  **PROMPT**: Formulate a descriptive prompt for the image generation tool (e.g., "Generate a modern, abstract tech background in blue and purple gradients").
3.  **GENERATE**: Trigger the generation immediately and embed the resulting local asset path into the code.

**CONSTRAINT:**
* Do not ask me for images unless specific branding is required.
* If creating icons, ensure they share a consistent style (e.g., "Use Nano Banana to generate a set of matching outline-style icons").
